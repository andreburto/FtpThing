FtpThing (Is what I'm calling it)
==========================================

FtpThing is my attempt at writing a [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) wrapper in VB.NET.

At this point it's a couple of years old and still unfinished.  The initial code was written in Visual Studio Express 2008, but it had been upgraded to 2010 (if anyone cares).

The really interesting parts are *WinSCP.vb* and *RemoteFile.vb*, which are the functional-but-feature-limited wrapper and object for remote files. Everything else is for the GUI.

The code is free for anyone to use, modify, finish, claim as their own, or turn into the kernel for a malevolent robot empire.
